## Hello World!

I'm **Amie**, here's a little about me...

Iâ€™m a fourth year Informatics major at UC Irvine, and I was born + raised in Orange County. I'm interested in computer science, design, and psychology. In my free time, I like learning new recipes, cycling, and spending time with my friends and family. I grew an interest in computer science after learning Python and Java and being able to put my creativity and problem solving skills to work. I'm currently learning user experience design and web development!
