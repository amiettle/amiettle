## Hello World!

I'm **Amie**, here's a little about me...

Iâ€™m a 3rd year Informatics major at UC Irvine, and I was born + raised in Orange County. I'm interested in computer science, design, and pyschology. In my free time, I like reading, rollerblading, and spending time with my friends and family. I grew an interest in computer science after learning Python and Java and being able to put my creativity and problem solving skills to work. I'm currently learning web development with HTML/CSS (and soon JS).
